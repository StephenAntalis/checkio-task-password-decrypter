    Jack is the primary network administrator at a major law firm. Like most IT professionals, 
    he loves the outdoors and goes hiking nearly every chance he gets. Three days ago he left 
    the office for a week long hiking excursion in the Swiss Alps and left a single flash drive
    in your care in case anything went wrong in his absence.
</p>
<p>
    The law firm regularly hires security experts to try to hack into your firm’s networks in 
    order to expose any vulnerabilities that a hacker could exploit. This morning one of the 
    hackers exposed a minor hole on one of the networks that, if properly exploited, could allow
    hackers to elevate the privileges of normal users into super users. Your company quickly came
    up with a patch that would fix the problem. However, this network was specifically designed so
    only a command from your company’s primary network administrator could initiate network updates.
</p>
<p>
    Unfortunately, this means only Jack’s account is capable of initiating the patch. Since this
    exploit is capable of compromising all data on that particular network, the company has informed
    you that you must immediately install the patch onto the exposed network. Fortunately you know
    that his flash drive contains a means of extracting his primary network password. You opened 
    the drive and immediately recognize that both of the files on the drive are encrypted using AES
    encryption. On a hunch, you attempt to decrypt both of the files using your personal private key. 
    One of the files becomes instantly readable but the other remains unintelligible garbage. The 
    legible document states:
</p>
<p>
    "If you are reading this, I am currently indisposed. The second enclosed document on this drive
    is encrypted using my own personal brand of encryption. In order to obtain all of my passwords,
    you must run it through my own unique band of decryption software.
  
</p>

<p><i>
    In order to decrypt the passwords, you must create a program capable of taking in a single string 
    as input. If the string has an even number of characters, start with the first and last character, 
    then second and second to last character, moving inwards, take their ascii values, convert 
    them to base 2 and do <b>XOR</b> on the last 6 binary numbers of each pair. The rest of the numbers are 
    <b>AND</b>ed together. If there is an odd number of characters, then the middle letter will have its 
    last 6 characters <b>inverted</b> (all 1s to 0s and all 0s to 1). Then these numbers will be converted 
    back to their base 10 ascii characters and output the message in the order of outside to inside."</i></p>

    <strong>Input: </strong> An encrypted password, a string (unicode).
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The decrypted password, a string.
